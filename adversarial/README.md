# Adversarial node for Cardano-Antithesis

The idea is to create an executable which:

- can be triggered by Antithesis
- behaves like a node but with unusual (possible adversarial) behaviours
- in order to test the "real" nodes in the cluster run by Antithesis

Cardano protocol details:

- Node to client protocol (we act like a wallet)
- Specifically chain sync mini-protocol (p.21 of [Network-spec][Netspec])
- Unsual behaviours:
  * ask to sync to random intersection points (for example, blocks that might have been rolled back)

Overall approach:

1. Using tracer sidecar, get all intersection points from logs of nodes in cluster
2. Write these chain points into a file on disk
3. Adversarial node reads this file selects random points
4. Provide a command (to let Antithesis decide when to use it)
5. When command is called, select random point from file and do a chain sync

Implementation considerations:

- Make a Haskell executable
- Not absurd to start from scratch but can look at cardano-wallet code for inspiration
- Must have [ouroboros-network][Ouroboros] (and possibly ouroboros-consensus-cardano) as dependencies
- Might need external C libraries (libsodium)
- All this might make it necessary to use Nix to get all dependencies working


TODO:
- context
- what it does
- who is it for
- why one would use it

Any details requiring more than three short paragraphs should go in a separate document (typically a white paper).
